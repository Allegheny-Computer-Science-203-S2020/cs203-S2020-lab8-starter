# cs203-S2020-lab8-starter

Designed for use with [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/), this
repository contains the starter for Laboratory 8 in Computer Science 203. As
part of this assignment, you should answer all the questions in the
`reflection.md` file, furnishing evidence of your contributions to this week's
effort towards completing the long-term software engineering project and your
overall contributions towards finishing the project. Students who have questions
about this task should talk with the course instructor. Before the due date for
this laboratory assignment, please ensure that:

- Throughout the project, you made significant contributions to the shared
  GitHub repository for each week of the long-term software engineering project,
  as evidenced by commits to the master branch of the repository that you and
  your team members merged through the use of the GitHub Flow model.

- The build status for the shared GitHub repository for the software engineering
  project is passing. In particular, please ensure that all linting checks, for
  both the source code and technical writing, and all test cases are passing.

- The GitHub repository for the long-term software engineering project does not
  have any resolved issues in it that you could have and/or did already handled.

- The GitHub repository for the long-term software engineering project has a
  clear listing of any unresolved issues that you did not solve. There should be
  evidence that you and your team members have thought about how to address
  these unresolved issues as part of future work on the project.

- The GitHub repository for the long-term software engineering project has
  closed issues or merged pull requests for which there is evidence that you
  made a significant contribution to the task.

- This GitHub repository contains a completed reflection file. You need to
  complete the checklist and then make sure that you provide a thorough response
  to all of the technical writing questions in this file. Please make sure that
  the contents of your reflection file passes the linting checks that are run in
  Travis CI. Please use this file to furnish clear evidence of your
  contributions to this long-term software engineering project.

- This GitHub repository contains a completed assessment file. Notably, you
  should copy over the assessment file from the previous week and then continue
  to add to that version of the file as you demonstrate the mastery of new
  technical and professional skills in software engineering throughout this
  week. You need to write a paragraph that explains your current level of
  mastery for a specific technical or professional skill and then justify why
  you are making that assessment. Please make sure that the contents of your
  assessment file passes the linting checks that are run in Travis CI.

- You have followed the required best practices for asking the course instructor
  for feedback on your overall assessment of the work that you completed for
  this long-term software engineering.

## Automated Checks with GatorGrader

Please remember that this assignment includes a rigorous assessment of your work
on the long-term software engineering project as, by the completion of this
week, we will have completed the long-term project. This means that in addition
to meeting all of the requirements outlined in the assignment sheet, your
submission must pass the following checks that
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) automatically
assesses:

- The assessment.md in  has at least 50 paragraph(s)
- The assessment.md in  has exactly 12 of the `heading` tag
- The command output has exactly 0 of the `Add Your Name Here` fragment
- The command output has exactly 0 of the `Add Your Name Here` fragment
- The command output has exactly 0 of the `TODO` fragment
- The command output has exactly 0 of the `TODO` fragment
- The file assessment.md exists in the  directory
- The file conduct.md exists in the  directory
- The file reflection.md exists in the  directory
- The reflection.md in  has at least 500 word(s) in total
- The reflection.md in  has exactly 14 of the `heading` tag
- The reflection.md in  has exactly 2 of the `code_block` tag
- The reflection.md in  has exactly 6 of the `list` tag
- The repository has at least 5 commit(s)

If [GatorGrader's](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) automated
checks pass correctly, the tool will produce the output like the following in
addition to returning a zero exit code (which you can access by typing the
command `echo $?`).

```
        ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
        ┃ Passed 15/15 (100%) of checks for cmpsc-203-spring-2020-lab8! ┃
        ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```

## Following the Code of Conduct

Throughout the completion of this software engineering project you should have
adhered to the code of conduct that we developed as part of a previous
laboratory assignment. In addition to reporting any violations of the code of
conduct, please make sure that you attest to the fact that you regularly
followed the code of conduct. Students who think that the software engineering
team should revise some aspect of the code of conduct must use the GitHub issue
tracker for that repository to suggest, discuss, and implement any required
changes. Please note that, at the time this project was released, the members of
the software engineering team did not finish the code of conduct and thus the
instructor released the incomplete version to all students in the course.

## Documenting Your Mastery of Technical and Professional Skills

Even though this long-term software engineering project involves a multiple-week
effort, you were expected to make significant contributions to the project every
week. As a means for documenting your contributions to this project, you should
fully complete the reflection document and, additionally, annotate the
assessment guide to track your mastery of the professional and technical skills
in the field of software engineering. For every category for which you decide an
assessment is appropriate, you should write a complete paragraph that reports
your current level of mastery and the evidence that you would furnish to support
your assessment. If there is not a paragraph next to one of the assessment
criteria, then the instructor will assume that you are currently working at the
:disappointed: level. Please note that you are responsible for documenting your
mastery of all the technical and professional skills in software engineering
since we have now completed this long-term software project.

## Assignment Assessment

Taking inspiration from the principles of [specification-based
grading](http://rtalbert.org/return-to-specs-grading-calculus/), the grade that
a student receives on this assignment will have the following components:

- **Travis CI Build Status**: Since additional checks on the source code and/or
  technical writing may be encoded in Travis CI's actions, students will receive
  a checkmark grade if their last before-the-deadline build passes and a green
  &#x2714; appears in their GitHub commit log instead of a red &#x2717;. As with
  the previous grading component, students are encouraged to repeatedly revise
  their source code and technical writing in an attempt to get their Travis CI
  build to pass.

- **Mastery of Technical Writing**: Students will also receive a checkmark grade
  when the responses to the technical writing questions presented in the
  `reflection.md` and `assessment.md` reveal a mastery of both writing skills
  and technical knowledge. To receive a checkmark grade, the submitted writing
  should have correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation in addition to
  following the rules of Markdown and providing technically accurate answers.
  Students are encouraged to ask the course instructor or a student technical
  leader to use the GitHub issue tracker to provide feedback on their mastery of
  technical writing skills.

- **Mastery of Technical Knowledge and Skills**: Students will also receive a
  checkmark grade when their GitHub repository reveals that they have mastered
  all of the technical knowledge and skills developed during the completion of
  this assignment. As a part of this grade, the instructor will assess aspects
  of the project including, but not limited to, the use of effective Markdown
  syntax and appropriate Git commit messages. Students are encouraged to ask the
  course instructor or a student technical leader to use the GitHub issue
  tracker to provide feedback on how well their work demonstrates mastery of the
  assignment's technical knowledge and skills.

All grades for this week of the long-term software engineering assignment will
be reported through a student's GitHub repository using either messages in the
GitHub commit log or issues raised in the issue tracker. Students should ask
questions about their grade for this project in GitHub so as to facilitate an
effective conversation about the submitted deliverables. As described in the
assignment sheet for this long-term software engineering project, you will also
receive a separate percentage grade for your overall contributions to the
long-term software engineering project. The team as a whole will receive a
baseline grade for the project and then your grade may be higher or lower than
or equal to the baseline depending on the quality of your contributions, your
assessment, and your written reflection.

## Problems with the Assignment

If you have any problems with the completion of this assignment, then please
create an issue in this repository using the "Issues" link at the top of this
site. Before this assignment is submitted by the due date, all the issues in
this repository should have been assigned to a team member, discussed, handled,
marked as resolved, and then closed.

## Project Feedback

Students who wish to receive feedback on their work for this practical
assignment should first open an issue on the issue tracker for this GitHub
repository, giving an appropriate title and description for the type of feedback
that you would like the course instructor to provide. After creating this issue,
you will see that GitHub has created a unique web site that references this
